# city_explorer_api

**Author**: Karlo Mangubat
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are building a server that communicates with the front end where the user would type a city name and it get gives the result of the location and the weather.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

1. Create a Repository on GitHub
2. Install dependencies
3. Create a server.js to create a server on port 3000

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We will be utilizing Heroku, GitHub, Terminal, and VS Code. 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

10-15-2020 10:45pm - The application can bring up error messages... I hope. The code was from collaborating with classmates and referencing the demo code.
